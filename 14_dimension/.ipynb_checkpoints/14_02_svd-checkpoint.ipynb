As we saw in the example above already, if $\\Sigma$ is not a square matrix, a lot of the column vectors in $U$ are irrelevant since they correspond to zero-value eigenvalues. Moreover, in practice, you'd have many eigenvalues that are very small. Since the values in $\\Sigma$ are ordered from big to small, we could significantly reduce the dimensions of $\\Sigma$ by limiting this matrix to an actual square matrix of dimension $k$, only containing the first $k$ rows and columns of $\\Sigma$, and throwing away the smallest singular values.\n",

Since we truncate only the smallest singular values, this loss in accuracy is only small if we choose $k$ large enough. This is a small price for a huge gain in insight in our data."

As always with Natural Language Processing (NLP), we transform our $N$ documents into a $N \\times n$ feature matrix, where each column represents a certain word or n-gram (e.g., using `CountVectorizer`).  Please refer to the **notebook about LSA** in this folder for a clear demonstration about this.\n",

    "- $U$ is a square matrix consisting of the eigenvectors of $AA^T$, and\n",
    "- $\\Sigma^2$ is a square diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $AA^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means they are unique set of points that can be scaled by the covariance matrix but not rotated.  Therefore, they represent a new set of axes for our space.  This means our data can be shifted form our current axes or perspective to a new coordinate system - we can move our data points from samples in our feature space to samples in some underlying concept space. Pease refer to the **notebook about PCA** for an in-depth look into the math behind this.\n",
