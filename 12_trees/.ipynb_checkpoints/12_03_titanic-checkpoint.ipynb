    "We want to examine survival rates on the RMS Titanic, and more importantly, who was it that survived? Given that we want to know the **features** that contributed to one's survival on that fateful shipwreck, **decision trees** seem quite suited to this purpose.\n",

    "Let's take a look at some of the variables in the dataset.\n",

    "**VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:**\n",
    "* survival   -     Survival\n",

    "* pclass     -     Passenger Class\n",
